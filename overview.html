 	This project implements movement path search in a grid of squares or hexagons. Both hexagons
	(hexes) and squares are tiles, and can be handled as such without knowing precise type. For
	each of these two tile types, a grid can be created in varying sizes. It will be filled with
	pre-created tiles. Hexes are placed in the grid in rows, and don't form vertical columns. A
	tile can have terrain, obstacles, movement events and blocks, which can influence movement in
	various ways. An obstacle has a template, which can determine multiple tiles which the obstacle
	resides in, based on a main tile and facing direction. An extension of obstacles are mobile
	objects, which have movement modes that enable them to move. A mobile object can have several
	movement modes, but only one at a time is active and in use. Movement modes can have movement
	modifiers, which can affect movement in various ways. A default movement mode implementation is
	included. This allows a mobile object to move from each tile to any adjacent tile, and uses a
	breadth-first search to find all tiles the mobile object can reach.
